# Restless

Restless is a small in-memory implant using C#. It uses SharpPcap, which uses Npcap APIs internally. Npcap is a new standard library update to the old WinPcap library.  

Restless is a C2 that controls implants using ICMP-like packets. Restless implant listens for specific ICMP-like packets and applies instructions given by Restless-CLI.py. Restless Controller/Server can task clients to execute pre-baked or arbitrary commands.
